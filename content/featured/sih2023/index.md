We developed a platform that allows users to upload their documents. These documents are then vectorized and embedded, and subsequently fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate contextual answers. Additionally, we integrated docTR to extract information from images. We also incorporated models to summarize and perform grammar checks on documents, further enhancing the utility and efficiency of our tool
